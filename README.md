### Regression and classification with housing data

There are two components to the project:

1. Estimate the sale price of properties based on their "fixed" characteristics, such as neighborhood, lot size, number of stories, etc.
2. Estimate the value of possible changes and renovations to properties from the variation in sale price not explained by the fixed characteristics. Your goal is to estimate the potential return on investment (and how much you should be willing to pay contractors) when making specific improvements to properties.

This project uses the Ames housing data recently made available on kaggle.
